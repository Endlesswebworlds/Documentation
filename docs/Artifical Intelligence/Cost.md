# Cost

Running AI will cost you AI-Gas, so if someone joins your world and uses it, it will cost you 1 AI-Gas per AI request. 
Always keep this in mind before you start using AI.
Try to minimize the usage and encourage interactive interactions just when needed.

Everyone gets 100 AI-Gas at the beginning to try out AI and can purchase it later on the marketplace.

You can find your AI-Gas at your profile wallet
