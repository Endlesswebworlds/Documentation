## Node

You can find the source [here](https://github.com/Endlesswebworlds/EwwNode)

Nodes are responsible for managing the dynamic world data within the game, can be hosted and maintained by anyone on a virtual private server (VPS) or similar
platform. These nodes are responsible for fetching dynamic world data from the designated blockchain and delivering it to the client upon request. In order to
update dynamic world data, a node must pay gas fees in the designated currency and have permission from the current owner to do so.

The main feature of nodes is to handle all online movement of players and NPCs within the game world, ensuring that all in-game actions are tracked and
accurately represented in real-time. They are responsible for the liveliness of the game, allowing players to interact and move freely within the world.

Nodes can be used privately or publicly, and their code can be modified to suit different purposes. This flexibility allows for a wide range of customizations
and applications for different worlds.
