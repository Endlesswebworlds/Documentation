\$EWW is the first currency that allows users to purchase items at a discounted price when compared to other currencies on the marketplace. This means that by holding and using EWW tokens, users will have access to exclusive deals and savings when purchasing items on the platform. This incentivizes users to hold and use EWW tokens, making it a valuable asset for users of the platform.

## Staking

We planning to offer multiple staking pools on public pools. These pools will allow individuals to stake their cryptocurrency and earn rewards for doing so.

In addition to these public pools, we are also developing an individual staking pool where users can unlock upgrades or discounts by staking for a specific timeframe. This means that by holding a certain amount of cryptocurrency and staking it for a certain period, users will be able to access exclusive benefits that are not available to non-stakers.

For example, users who stake for a minimum of 3 months may receive a discount on our products or services. Or, those who stake for a longer period of time may be able to access advanced features on our platform.
We believe that this innovative approach to staking will not only benefit our users, but also drive more adoption and usage of our platform.
