For example, to perform transfers it is necessary to provide the EwwLocker funds. These funds can be taken back by the respective provider at any time.

Currently there is no interface to provide funds so this has to be done manually in the [EwwLocker contract](https://github.com/Endlesswebworlds/EwwLocker).

#### The first contract is deployed on zkSync here

You can deploy it at any chain you want but it is important to make an allowance to the eww-node server which is [TODO]
