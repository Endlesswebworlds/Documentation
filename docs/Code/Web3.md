For example, to perform transfers it is necessary to provide the EwwLocker funds. These funds can be taken back by the respective provider at any time.

Currently there is no interface to provide funds so this has to be done manually in the [EwwLocker contract](https://github.com/Endlesswebworlds/EwwLocker).
