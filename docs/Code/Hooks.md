Hooks tell when a code should be executed, there are different hooks which are useful depending on the situation.

<hr />

`Create` = The code will be executed if the player enters a room

`Destroy` = The code will be executed if the asset is destroyed

`Interact` = The code will be executed if the player interacts with the object

`Over` = The code will be executed if the player is over the object

`Next` = The code will be executed if the player is next to the object



Please note : World code will always execute on start, hooks cant be changed here
